Inter smart:
Inter smart is a modern web designing compony which is located in Kochi, Kerala, India. It is a dynamic and innovative web designing compony committed to delivering creative solutions tailored to client’s digital needs. They Specialized in crafting visually appealing and user-friendly websites.
Current IT Set up and Recommendations:
Currently they operate with a non-cloud IT infrastructure. The current setup entails on-premise servers for website hosting and nearby storage of fact management. While this presents direct manage over the neighbourhood environment, it poses obstacles in scalability and adaptability. The reliance on traditional hosting methods may lead to higher upfront costs for hardware maintenance. Additionally, the non-cloud protection measures may not provide the real-time danger detection and non-stop monitoring abilities.
To optimise efficiency and adaptability, inter smart is recommended to transition to a cloud-based IT infrastructure. For website hosting, leveraging cloud services like Azure would offer scalability and cost-effectiveness. Specifically employing Platform as a service (PaaS) model for application hosting and cloud databases, such as Azure database  can streamline operations. Implementing cloud safety solutions such as Azure security center ensures strong safety in opposition to evolving cyber threats.



Customer relationship management:
Inter smart uses a traditional non-cloud CRM system. The domestic database requires substantial hardware resources and manual maintenance, limiting scalability and responsiveness to changing needs. Additionally local hosting of applications incurs higher upfront costs for dedicated servers. 

To enhance the customer relationship management, Inter smart is advised to transition to a cloud-based CRM infrastructure. Adopting cloud databases, such as Azure Database, will offer scalability, cost efficiency, and automated backups. Cloud hosting platforms like Azure provide the flexibility needed for uneven rise based on demand, optimising performance and reducing hosting costs. This cloud-based approach aligns with the companies growth objectives, ensuring a more quick, secure and cost-effective CRM system tailored to the evolving needs of a small web designing business in India. 

WEB DESIGN:
The present web design infrastructure of Inter smart is based on an on-premise server-based on non-cloud approach. While this setup provides control over the local environment, it might not be as scalable or flexible enough to accommodable evolving web design specifications. A greater upfront cost for dedicated servers and hardware upkeep could arise from using traditional hosting techniques. Furthermore, a web design company may not be able to effectively expand resources in response to project needs if the non-cloud method has the dynamic flexibility that is required.

Suggestion for infrastructure for cloud-based web design: It is advised that Inter Smart switch to a cloud-based infrastructure in order to improve the efficiency of site creation. Azure and other cloud hosting services can offer the scalability needed for different project workloads. More specifically, flexibility and effective resource use are guaranteed when hosting is done with Azure Virtual Machines.  The cost-effective scalability provided by these cloud-based recommendations enables Inter Smart to effectively adjust to a variety of project requirements.

Email and Recommendation:
The Company is currently using Microsoft 365.It is advised to keep cloud-based email communication option. To enhance the existing setup, inter smart should explore advanced features within Microsoft 365.considering company’s web design focus, utilizing Microsoft 365’s collaborative tools can further streamline communication and project management.

Final thoughts: 
To sum up, the suggested changes for Inter smart’s email correspondence, web design, and IT architecture represent a tactical move in the direction of cloud- based solutions, particularly Microsoft 365 and Azure. By using cloud technologies, inter smart will have increased cooperation, cost effectiveness and scalability. Moving to Azure guarantees a hosting and web design environment that is dynamic and adaptable, perfectly lining with the company’s growth trajectory.
